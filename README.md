# Hi, Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„

I am a Software Engineer who has about 4 years of working experience, specializing in Frontend. I have experience working at platform and product teams

One key achievement in the platform side was increasing build performance of 2 webapps by 43%. Another one was optimizing API latency by 42%. One key achievement in the product side was working on CPO (cost-per-order) that drove $1.27M of revenue in only 2 months after launch

I also am proud to have the soft skills to pay the bills :D

At Grab, as a new joiner, I influenced the team about best practices in web development and conducted team events for learning. Team got the chance to learn 155 relevant topics in only 1 year. There I was selected as a speaker of 10 out of 48 (about 20,8%)Â team sharing sessions during the year

Besides work, I like to give back to the community and help people in software engineering:
- I was a Glints Expert guest content creator talking about work life balance
- I created Youtube tutorials about competitive programming and frontend stuff
- I was the speaker of 2 days workshop about Frontend and Backend with over 100 registrants
- I am a mentor in Dealls Indonesian National Mentoring Festival helping people to pursue postgraduate studies. With a 100% recommendation rate rating
