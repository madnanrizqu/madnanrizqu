### Providing Software Engineering Services
As a Software Engineer, I have been a professional in the industry for 4 years in high profile companies such as Grab and Ruangguru. I've worked on both product teams and platform teams. I also have a rare disposition of influencing without authority. So I believe i have the unique blend experience and skills to generate impact in any team! 

Grab is Southeast Asiaâ€™s leading everyday everything app. There I was a web platform engineer who also worked on product related work. One key achievement in the platform side was increasing build performance of 2 webapps by 43%. One key achievement in the product side was working on CPO (cost-per-order) that drove $1.27M of revenue in only 2 months after launch.

On the soft skill spectrum, at Grab as a new joiner, I influenced the team about best practices in web development and conducted team events for learning. Team got the chance to learn 155 relevant topics in only 1 year. There I was selected as a speaker of 10 team sharing session during the year.

Along my journey, i have developed skills in React.js, Redux, Vue.js, Vuex, Javascript, Typescript, ReasonML/ReScript, Jest, Vitest, Cypress, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and SQL.

It's my passion to create web projects. I hope I can help you with what you need! Contact me through Linkedin Direct Message or via email here madnanrizqullah@gmail.com
